diffing algorithom, hydration

REACT IS A LIBRARY : - framework vs library - framework is military - focuses on rules foucuses on conventions - library is cool dude - no converntions

TOPIC TO LEARN : - core of react (state or UI manipulation, JSX) - component Reusability - Reusing of component (Props - porperties) - how to propogate change (hooks)

ADDITIONAL ADD ON TO REACT : - router (react don't have router) - new package - react-router-dom - state management (react don't have state management) - redux, redux tookit, zustand, context api - class based component - legacy code :-( ) - BAAS apps - backend as as service -firebase - superbase - freeApi.app by hiteshcode - social media close, e-commerce app .....
